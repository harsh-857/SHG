            <h1>About Self Help Groups (SHGs)</h1>
            <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                Self Help Groups (SHGs) are community-based voluntary associations, mainly consisting of women, formed to promote financial inclusion, self-employment, and social empowerment in India. SHGs play a vital role in strengthening rural and semi-urban economies by enabling women to collectively save money, access credit, and undertake income-generating activities.
            </p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                In India, SHGs are actively promoted under government initiatives such as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission) and State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs). These programs focus on organizing women into groups, providing skill development, capacity building, and linking them to banks and markets.
